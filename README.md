## Purpose
The primary aim of this project is to create a printable guitar chords booklet for everyone.  
This booklet provides a lot of possibilities: you can update it with new songs without reprinting the whole book, you can share this booklet with your friends, you can use it for bringing the music to every street of the world, or rather, you can become a GuitarHub hero.

## Considerations
This book is meant mainly for the guitar players who would like to have a chords book that is updated periodically without the loss of formatting and any other related problems.  
It is highly recommended to print the content of this booklet and put it in a ring notebook - when a new song is added you can print it out and place it in a desired location. In order to avoid inconsistencies when adding the new songs to your collection, the pages are not labeled with any numbers. You can, for example, order the songs alphabetically.  

## Features
* the booklet is available to be printed at once, including all the songs till date and then you can expand it by adding the newly released songs without the necessity to reprint the whole booklet;
* the format of a single page is ISO A5 which supports the idea of  portability;
* creating songs with musical note names in both absolute and solfege systems;
