\section*{Preface}
The primary aim of this project is to create a printable booklet with guitar chords.\par
This book is meant mainly for the guitar players that would like to have a chords book that is updated periodically without the losage of formatting and any other related problems.\\
It is highly recommended to print the content of this booklet and put it in a ring notebook - when a new song is added you can print it out and add it to a desired location.\\
In order to avoid inconsistencies in adding new songs to your collection, songs are not labeled with any numbers. You can, for example, order the songs alphabetically.\par
