		%verse
		\[Dm]Hello darkness, my old \[C]friend
		I've come to talk with you \[Dm]again
		Because a \[F]vision soft\[B&]ly creep\[F]ing
		Left its seeds while I \[B&]was sleep\[F]ing
		And the \[B&]vision that was planted in my \[F]brain
		Still rem\[Dm]ain
		\[F] Within the \[C]sound of \[Dm]silence
	\endverse
	\beginverse
		^In restless dreams I walked ^alone
		Narrow streets of cobbled ^stone
		'Neath the ^halo of ^a street ^lamp
		I turned my collar to the ^cold and ^damp
		When my ^eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon ^light
		That split the ^night
		^ And touched the ^sound of ^silence
	\endverse
	\beginverse
		^And in the naked light I ^saw
		Ten thousand people, maybe ^more
		People ^talking with^out speak^ing
		People hearing with^out listen^ing
		People writing ^songs that voices never ^share
		No one ^dare
		^ Disturb the ^sound of ^silence
	\endverse
	\beginverse
		^"Fools" said I, "You do not ^know
		Silence like a cancer ^grows
		Hear my ^words that I ^might teach ^you
		Take my arms that I ^might reach ^you"
		But my ^words like silent raindrops ^fell
		^And ech^oed
		In the ^wells of ^silence
	\endverse
	\beginverse
		^And the people bowed and ^prayed
		To the neon god they ^made
		And the ^sign flashed out ^its warn^ing
		In the words that it ^was form^ing
		And the sign said
		"The ^words of the prophets are written on the subway ^walls
		And tenement ^halls"
		And ^whispered in the ^sounds of ^silence
