		%verse
		Now and then I think of when we were together
		Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
		Told myself that you were right for me
		But felt so lonely in your company
		But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
	\endverse

	\beginverse*
		You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
		Like resignation to the end, always the end
		So when we found that we could not make sense
		Well you said that we would still be friends
		But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
	\endverse

	\beginchorus
		%chorus
		But you didn't have to cut me off
		Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
		And I don't even need your love
		But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
		No you didn't have to stoop so low
		Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
		I guess that I don't need that though
		Now you're just somebody that I used to know \rep{3}
	\endchorus

	\textnote{Kimbra}
	\beginverse*
		Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
		But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
		But I don't wanna live that way
		Reading into every word you say
		You said that you could let it go
		And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
	\endverse

		Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
