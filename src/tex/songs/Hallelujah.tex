\beginverse
I \[G]heard there was a \[Em]secret chord
that \[G]David played and it \[Em]pleased the Lord
but \[C]you don't really \[D]care for music \[G]do you?\[D]
\[G]well it goes like this the \[C]fourth the \[D]fifth
the \[Em]minor fall and the \[C]major lift
the \[D]baffled king co\[B7]mposing halle\[Em]lujah
\endverse

\beginchorus
Halle\[C]lujah Halle\[Em]lujah Halle\[C]lujah Halle\[G]\[D]luj\[G]ah
\endchorus

\beginverse
well your ^faith was strong but you ^needed proof
you ^saw her bathing ^on the roof
her ^beauty and the ^moonlight over^threw you^
^she tied you to her ^kitchen ^chair
she ^broke your throne and she ^cut your hair
and ^from your lips you ^drew a halle^lujah
\endverse

\beginverse
^baby I've been ^here before
i've ^seen this room and I've ^walked this floor
i ^used to live ^alone before I ^knew you^
^I've seen your flag on the ^marble ^arch
but ^love is not a victory ^march
it's a ^cold and it's a ^broken halle^lujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Well ^there was a time when you ^let me know
what's ^really going ^on below
but ^now you never ^show that to me ^do you?^
but re^member when I ^moved in ^you
and the ^holy dove was ^moving too
and ^every breath we ^drew was halle^lujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Well, ^maybe there's a ^God above
but ^all I've ever ^learned from love
was ^how to shoot at ^somebody who out^drew you^
it's ^not a cry that you ^hear at ^night
it's ^not somebody who's ^seen the light
it's a ^cold and it's a ^broken halle^lujah
\endverse
