\beginverse\memorize 
\[Dm]Hello darkness, my old \[C]friend
I've come to talk with you \[Dm]again
Because a \[F]vision soft\[B&]ly creep\[F]ing
Left its seeds while I \[B&]was sleep\[F]ing
And the \[B&]vision that was planted in my \[F]brain
Still rem\[Dm]ain
\[F] Within the \[C]sound of \[Dm]silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^In restless dreams I walked ^alone
Narrow streets of cobbled ^stone
'Neath the ^halo of ^a street ^lamp
I turned my collar to the ^cold and ^damp
When my ^eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon ^light
That split the ^night
^ And touched the ^sound of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^And in the naked light I ^saw
Ten thousand people, maybe ^more
People ^talking with^out speak^ing
People hearing with^out listen^ing
People writing ^songs that voices never ^share
No one ^dare
^ Disturb the ^sound of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^"Fools" said I, "You do not ^know
Silence like a cancer ^grows
Hear my ^words that I ^might teach ^you
Take my arms that I ^might reach ^you"
But my ^words like silent raindrops ^fell
^And ech^oed
In the ^wells of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^And the people bowed and ^prayed
To the neon god they ^made
And the ^sign flashed out ^its warn^ing
In the words that it ^was form^ing
And the sign said
"The ^words of the prophets are written on the subway ^walls
And tenement ^halls"
And ^whispered in the ^sounds of ^silence
\endverse
