\beginverse
\[A]When the night has come
\[F#m]And the land is dark
And the \[D]moon is the \[E]only light we'll \[A]see
\[A]No I won't be afraid, no I \[F#m]won't be afraid
Just as \[D]long as you \[E]stand, stand by \[A]me
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A]So darlin', darlin', stand by me,
oh \[F#m]stand by me
Oh \[D]stand, \[E]stand by me,
stand by \[A]me
\endchorus

\beginverse
^If the sky that we look upon
^Should tumble and fall
Or the ^mountains should ^crumble to the ^sea
^I won't cry, I won't cry, no I ^won't shed a tear
Just as ^long as you ^stand, stand by ^me
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A]So darlin', darlin', stand by me,
oh \[F#m]stand by me
Oh \[D]stand, \[E]stand by me,
stand by \[A]me
\endchorus
