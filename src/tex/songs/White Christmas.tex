\[C]I'm dreaming of a \[Dm]white \[G]Christmas
\[F]Just like the \[G]ones I used to \[C]know
Where the treetops \[C7]glisten,
and \[F]children \[Fm]listen
To \[C]hear \[Am]sleigh bells in the \[G]snow
\[C]I'm dreaming of a \[Dm]white \[G]Christmas
\[F]With every \[G]Christmas card I \[C]write
May your days be \[Em]merry and \[Am]bright\[F]
And may \[C]all your \[F]Christma\[G]ses be \[C]white

^Quel lieve tuo ^candor, ^neve
^discende ^lieto nel mio ^cuor;
nella notte ^Santa
il ^cuore ^esulta
^dâ€™amor: ^\`e Natale ^ancor.
^E viene gi\`u dal ^ciel, ^lento,
^un dolce ^canto ammalia^tor
che mi dice: ^prega anche ^tu^;
\`e ^Natale, ^non soff^rire ^pi\`u.
