\beginverse\memorize 
\[G]It's am\[D]azing how \[C]you can speak \[D]right to my \[G]heart \[D]\[C]\[D]
\[G]Without \[D]saying a \[C]word, you can \[D]light up the \[G]dark \[D]\[C]\[D]
\[C]Try as I may I can \[D]never explain
\[G]What I \[D]hear when you \[C]don't say a \[D]thing
\endverse

\beginchorus
The \[G]smile on your \[D]face lets me \[C]know that you \[D]need me
There's a \[G]truth in \[D]your eyes saying \[C]you'll never \[D]leave me
The \[G]touch of your \[D]hand says you'll \[C]catch me wherever I \[D]fall \[Em]\[D]
\[C]You say it best, \[D]when you say nothing at \[G]all \[D]\[C]\[D]
\endchorus

\beginverse
^All day ^long I can ^hear people ^talking out ^loud ^^^
^But when ^you hold me ^near, you ^drown out the ^crowd ^^^
^Try as they may they could ^never define
^What's been ^said between ^your heart and ^mine
